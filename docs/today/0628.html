The first group shounds, 'Liberate the bar!' and 'Fag power!' as they march in front of the Stonewall Inn. Following them are a group including a lesbian, someone holding a sign that reads 'SILENCE = DEATH', and a person dressed in leather. They chant together, 'Act up! Fight back! Fight AIDS!' The third group are all smiling, waving trans, bisexual, and LGBT rainbow flags.">
